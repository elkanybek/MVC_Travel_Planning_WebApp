## ⚒️Tools
The backend is built with Node.js and TypeScript, following the Models-Controllers-Views architecture to maintain a clean and organized codebase. For data storage, PostgreSQL is used alongside an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool to streamline database interactions. Docker is employed for containerization, ensuring consistent environments across different stages of development and deployment. The application handles HTTP requests, manages sessions and cookies, and employs templating for dynamic content rendering. Routing and promises are utilized to manage asynchronous operations and ensure smooth user experiences.
